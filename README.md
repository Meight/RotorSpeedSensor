# Measuring rotor speed with a smartphone camera

*by Matthieu LE BOUCHER and Thomas FAGET.*

# Abstract

Approach to measure the rotation speed of a rotor using a mark and a smartphone. We introduce a general mathematical method to approximate the rotation speed based on various videos of a rotating rotor, which leads to relative errors under 0.5% and converges over time.

The application is multi-threaded and therefore capable of performing calculations in real-time.
